#### Hello/Ahoj ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently finishing my masters in AI/ML at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University in Prague](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en). In addition to all things machine learning Iâ€™m also interested in computer languages and generally software engineering/computer science as a whole. When not playing with computer-related stuff I like to do curling, hike, swim, enjoy theatre, and read.
